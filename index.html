<h3 class="HTMLresult" class="result"> HTML </h3>
<p class="HTMLresult" class="result"> You know how to stick to the basics and keep everything organized with classes and id’s. You’ve got a knack for helping very different people get along to get the job done. Honestly, we all know that you’re the (admittedly ugly) rock of the group, and the website couldn’t even exist without you. Beauty is skin deep, but text is a website’s soul.
 </p>

<h3 class="CSSresult" class="result"> CSS </h3>
<p class="CSSresult" class="result"> Although some people may think you’re shallow with all your focus on appearances, anybody who has clicked on a beginner’s HTML-only website knows that nobody would want to use the Internet without you. People talk about how HTML (ew) started the Internet and how Javascript (ugh) helped it take off, but nobody appreciates the forgotten middle child: CSS.
 </p>

<h3 class="JSresult" class="result"> Javascript </h3>
<p class="JSresult" class="result"> Some people may call you an imposter (and they’re not completely wrong). Sure, sometimes you’re scrambled, and sometimes you don’t even know what’s going on with yourself. However, despite your scrambled appearance, you bring logic and reason to the group. Using somebody else’s code to get the job done - now THAT’s smart! Take that, other languages with syntax that actually makes sense!  </p>
